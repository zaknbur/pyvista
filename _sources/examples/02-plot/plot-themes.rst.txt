Change the Theme
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PyVista has a few coloring themes for you to choose!

.. code-block:: default

    import pyvista as pv
    from pyvista import examples







Define a simple plotting routine for comparing the themes


.. code-block:: default


    mesh = examples.download_st_helens().warp_by_scalar()

    def plot_example():
        p = pv.Plotter()
        p.add_mesh(mesh)
        p.add_bounding_box()
        return p.show()







PyVista's default color theme is chosen to be generally easy on your eyes
and is best used when working long hours on your visualization project.
The grey background and warm colormaps are chosen to make sure 3D renderings
do not drastically change the brightness of your screen when working in dark
environments.

Here's an example of our default plotting theme - this is what you would see
by default after running any of our examnples.


.. code-block:: default


    pv.set_plot_theme('default')

    plot_example()

    :class: sphx-glr-single-img




PyVista also ships with a few plotting themes:

* ``'ParaView'``: this is designed to mimic ParaView's default plotting theme
* ``'night'``: this is designed to be night-mode friendly with dark backgrounds and color schemes
* ``'document'``: this is built for use in document style plotting and making publication quality figures

Demo the ``'ParaView'`` theme


.. code-block:: default


    pv.set_plot_theme('ParaView')

    plot_example()
