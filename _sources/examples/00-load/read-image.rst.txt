Read Image Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Read and plot image files (JPEG, TIFF, PNG, etc).

.. code-block:: default


    from vtki import examples







``vtki`` fully supportes reading images into their own spatially referenced
data objects (this example) as well as supports texture mapping of images onto
datasets (see :ref:`ref_texture_example`).

Download a JPEG image of a puppy and load it to :class:`vtki.UniformGrid`.
This could similarly be implemented with any image file by using the
:func:`vtki.read` function and passing the path to the image file.


.. code-block:: default


    image = examples.download_puppy()
    # or...
    # image = vtki.read('my_image.jpg')







When plotting images stored in :class:`vtki.UniformGrid` objects, it is
important to specify usign the `rgb` option when plotting to ensure that the
image's true colors are used and not mapped.


.. code-block:: default


    # True image colors
    image.plot(rgb=True, cpos='xy')




.. image:: /examples/00-load/images/sphx_glr_read-image_001.png
    :class: sphx-glr-single-img





.. code-block:: default


    # Mapped image colors
    image.plot(cpos='xy')



.. image:: /examples/00-load/images/sphx_glr_read-image_002.png
