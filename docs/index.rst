About
*****

PyVista is a helper module for the Visualization Toolkit (VTK) that takes a
different approach on interfacing with VTK through NumPy and direct array
access. This package provides a Pythonic, well-documented interface exposing
VTK's powerful visualization backend to facilitate rapid prototyping, analysis,
and visual integration of spatially referenced datasets.

This module can be used for scientific plotting for presentations and research
papers as well as a supporting module for other mesh dependent Python modules.

Connections
===========

PyVista is a powerful tool that researchers can harness to create compelling,
integrated visualizations of large datasets in an intuitive, Pythonic manner.
Here are a few open-source projects that leverage PyVista:

* pyansys_: Pythonic interface to ANSYS result, full, and archive files
* PVGeo_: Python package of VTK-based algorithms to analyze geoscientific data and models. PyVista is used to make the inputs and outputs of PVGeo's algorithms more accessible.
* omfvista_: 3D visualization for the Open Mining Format (omf). PyVista provides the foundation for this library's visualization.
* discretize_: Discretization tools for finite volume and inverse problems. ``discretize`` provides ``toVTK`` methods that return PyVista versions of their data types for `creating compelling visualizations`_.
* pymeshfix_: Python/Cython wrapper of Marco Attene's wonderful, award-winning MeshFix software.
* tetgen_: Python Interface to Hang Si's C++ TetGen Library

Citing PyVista
==============

There is a `paper about PyVista <https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.01450>`_!

If you are using PyVista in your scientific research, please help our scientific
visibility by citing our work! Head over to :ref:`citation_ref` to learn more
about citing PyVista.


Getting Started
***************

If you have a working copy of VTK, installation is simply::

    $ pip install pyvista

You can also visit `PyPi <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyvista>`_ or
`GitHub <https://github.com/pyvista/pyvista>`_ to download the source.

See :ref:`install_ref` for more details.


Be sure to head over to the `examples gallery <./examples/index.html>`_
to explore different use cases of PyVista and to start visualizing 3D data in
Pyhton! Also, please explore the list of external projects leveraging PyVista
for 3D visualization in our `external examples list <./external_examples.html>`_

API Reference
*************

In this section, you can learn more about how PyVista wraps different VTK mesh
types and how you can leverage powerful 3D plotting and mesh analysis tools.
Highlights of the API include:

* Pythonic interface to VTK's Python-C++ bindings
* Filtering/plotting tools built for interactivity in Jupyter notebooks (see :ref:`ipy_tools_ref`)
* Direct access to common VTK filters (see :ref:`filters_ref`)
* Intuitive plotting routines with ``matplotlib`` similar syntax (see :ref:`plotting_ref`)
